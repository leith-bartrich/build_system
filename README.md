# build_system
A build system for Unity.  Requires uTomate.

Deprecated as of 2018.  I am moving away from Unity and to Unreal.  Feel free to adopt this code by forking it.

In time, I may remove the dependency on uTomate.  But for now, it's neccesary.  You will need to buy it yourself to use this
build system.  You can find uTomate in the Unity Asset Store.

This system is incomplete.  But its base functionality is useful for developing assetpackages.
