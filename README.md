# build_system
A build system for Unity.  Requires uTomate.

In time, I may remove the dependency on uTomate.  But for now, it's neccesary.  You will need to buy it yourself to use this
build system.  You can find uTomate in the Unity Asset Store.

This system is incomplete.  But its base functionality is useful for developing assetpackages.
